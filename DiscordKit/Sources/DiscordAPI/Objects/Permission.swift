/*
 From discord docs:
 Roles represent a set of permissions attached to a group of users.
 Roles have names, colors, and can be "pinned" to the side bar,
 causing their members to be listed separately. Roles can have
 separate permission profiles for the global context (guild) and
 channel context. The @everyone role has the same ID as the guild it belongs to.
