# API Objects ðŸ§±

Welcome, to the folder of endless structs and enums!
Here, a public struct for almost every Discord object that can be
sent to or received from the API exists, with enums for the
public struct properties that are fitting to be turned into an enum.

Changing any public struct or public enum can have a snowball effect since
each public struct is usually referenced by 5 others.

Most of the files in here are close to or longer than 100
lines, so take care!
