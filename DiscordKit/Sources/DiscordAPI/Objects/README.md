# API Objects 🧱

Welcome, to the folder of endless structs and enums!
Here, a struct for almost every Discord object that can be
sent to or received from the API exists, with enums for the
public struct properties that are fitting to be turned into an enum.

Changing any struct or enum can have a snowball effect since
each struct is usually referenced by 5 others.

Most of the files in here are close to or longer than 100
lines, so take care!
