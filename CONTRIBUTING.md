# Contributing

Thank you for popping by! If you know the Discord API well, 
have Swift knowledge, and feel like contributing, feel free to
make a pull request! Any (positive) contribution is welcome,
no matter how small! You can also join the Swiftcord Discord server
to discuss improvements and bug fixes!

Found an issue? Ensure it isn't a duplicate, then open a new issue
with the appropriate template and fill in the placeholders as
clearly as you can. Responding promptly to follow-up comments
is appreciated, as debugging is hard without any further input
from the OP.
