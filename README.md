This project aims to create a fully functional native Discord
client in Swift for macOS from scratch.

I'd also recommend checking out [DiscordKit](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/DiscordKit),
the Discord API implementation Swiftcord relies on.

**If you like this project, please give it a ⭐ star! It helps motivate
me to continue developing it**

## Motivation

Swiftcord was created to offer a Discord-like UI and experience while
having the performance and memory benefits of native apps. The idea started
brewing when I was tight on RAM, then noticed Discord using 600+MB of RAM.
I then realized that was the perfect opportunity to explore SwiftUI,
since it was relatively new to me at that time. Hence, Swiftcord was born!

## FAQ

Covers a few common questions I have encountered, click on the question
to expand the answer

<details>
  <summary><b>Will I get banned for using Swiftcord/Is using Swiftcord illegal?</b></summary>
  Using Swiftcord <i>isn't illegal</i>. Contrary to what many people say
  on various platforms, 3rd party clients (i.e. Swiftcord) <b>aren't against</b>
  the Discord ToS. You can read the section in Discord's ToS regarding their software
  <a href="https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord’s-services">here</a>. 
  However, I <b>cannot guarantee</b> Swiftcord's use of Discord's endpoints won't
  trip selfbot ban detection. As far as possible, Swiftcord aims to
  use endpoints as similarly to the official client as possible, and I (the developer)
  have not been banned for using Swiftcord with either my main or alt account.
  <i>
    I do not take any responsibility for account bans due to the use of Swiftcord,
    whether direct or indirect, although there's a very low possibility of that occurring. 
    I recommend trying Swiftcord with an alt if possible.
  </i>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Feature <i>x</i> is missing! When will <i>y</i> be implemented?</b></summary>
  Swiftcord currently is in the alpha stage, and hasn't achieved feature
  parity with the official Discord client yet (it's quite far behind). 
  Many features are on the <a href="#roadmap">roadmap</a>, but I do not
  currently have a timeline for them. Development is progressing at a 
  fast pace, but sometimes bugs may take an unexpectedly long time to fix.
  I appreciate contributions, bug reports, and suggestions :)
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Swiftcord just crashed!</b></summary>
  Although I'm aiming for 0 crashes (which is made easy by Swift),
  sometimes the unexpected happens xD. If you experience a crash, please
  open an issue with appropriate information like the line the error
  occurs on, relevant logs, and what you were doing that might have caused
  the crash. If you can solve the bug causing the crash, that's even better!
</details>

## Current State

Implemented most core message-related features from the official
client, including basic markdown and embeds, stickers (lottie/PNG),
and editing and deleting events. You can now send attachments (both
from the file picker and by dragging and dropping) with your messages too! 
DMs now have first-class support!

More advanced features like voice channels & editing messages etc 
aren't supported yet, refer to the [roadmap](#roadmap) below.

Gateway connection event handling is stable, and reconnection
is rock solid (as far as I can test). If you encounter a reconnection
bug (not reconnecting, reconnection loop, etc), please open an issue
with the relevant logs.

## Roadmap

I do not have a definite timeline for when a feature would be implemented,
and they may not necessarily be implemented in sequence. 

- ✅ Gateway/REST API Implementation
- ✅ Load server list, channels, and message
- ✅ Basic message, channel, and server rendering
- ✅ Rich message rendering (stickers, embeds, markdown, media)
- ✅ Message replies
- ✅ Load and display full user profile (bio + roles)
- ✅ Save the last server and last channel viewed in servers (QoL)
- ✅ Better loading screen
- ✅ Find and request the most optimized photo size from CDN
- ⏱ Partial user and app settings
- ✅ DM and group loading
- ✅ Display DMs properly in UI
- ✅ Send DM messages
- ✅ Send attachments
- ❌ User roles + overwrites
- ❌ Message notifications
- ❌ Full list of users in a server, especially for larger servers (1000+ members)
- ✅ Ordering of channels, servers, and categories
- ❌ Threads support
- ❌ Full user settings
- ❌ Server creation
- ❌ Server discovery
- ❌ Server banner, boost widget, and other misc. boosted features

no matter how small! You can also join the Swiftcord Discord server
to discuss improvements and bug fixes!

Found an issue? Ensure it isn't a duplicate, then open a new issue
with the appropriate template and fill in the placeholders as
clearly as you can. Responding promptly to follow-up comments
is appreciated, as debugging is hard without any further input
from the OP.
