This project aims to create a fully functional native Discord
client in Swift for macOS from scratch.

I'd also recommend checking out [DiscordKit](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/DiscordKit),
the Discord API implementation Swiftcord relies on.

## Motivation

Swiftcord was created to offer a Discord-like UI and experience while
having the performance and memory benefits of native apps. The idea started
brewing when I was tight on RAM, then noticed Discord using 600+MB of RAM.
I then realized that was the perfect opportunity to explore SwiftUI,
since it was relatively new to me at that time. Hence, Swiftcord was born!

## FAQ

Covers a few common questions I have encountered, click on the question
to expand the answer

<details>
  <summary><b>Will I get banned for using Swiftcord/Is using Swiftcord illegal?</b></summary>
    Nobody really knows what Discord's official stance on unofficial clients is. 
    However, hundreds of people and I have been using Swiftcord for quite a while, 
    and nobody has been banned to date.
  <i>
    I do not take any responsibility for account bans due to the use of Swiftcord,
    whether direct or indirect, although there's a very low possibility of that occurring. 
    I recommend trying Swiftcord with an alt if possible.
  </i>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Feature <i>x</i> is missing! When will <i>y</i> be implemented?</b></summary>
  Swiftcord currently is in the alpha stage, and hasn't achieved feature
  parity with the official Discord client yet (it's quite far behind). 
  Many features are planned, but I do not currently have a timeline for them. 
  Development is progressing at a fast pace, but sometimes bugs may take an unexpectedly long time to fix.
  I appreciate contributions, bug reports, and suggestions :)
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Swiftcord just crashed!</b></summary>
  Although I'm aiming for 0 crashes (which is made easier by Swift),
  sometimes the unexpected happens xD. If you experience a crash, please
  open an issue with appropriate information like the line the error
  occurs on, relevant logs, and what you were doing that might have caused
  the crash. If you can solve the bug causing the crash, that's even better!
</details>

## Current State

Implemented most core message-related features from the official
client, including basic markdown and embeds, stickers (lottie/PNG),
and editing and deleting events. Animated media, like profile images, server icons
and profile banners are supported too! You can now send attachments (both
from the file picker and by dragging and dropping) with your messages too! 
DMs now have first-class support!

More advanced features like voice channels, editing messages, etc.
aren't supported yet.

Gateway connection event handling is stable, and reconnection
is rock solid (as far as I can test). If you encounter a reconnection
bug (not reconnecting, reconnection loop, etc), please open an issue
with the relevant logs.
