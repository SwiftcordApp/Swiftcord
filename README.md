Swiftcord is beautiful, follows design principals of the official client and most importantly, its fast!

Powered by [DiscordKit](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/DiscordKit), a Swift Discord implementation built
from the ground up.

## Motivation

Swiftcord was created to offer a Discord-like UI and experience while
having the performance and memory benefits of native apps. The idea started
brewing when I was tight on RAM, then noticed Discord using 600+MB of RAM.
I then realized that was the perfect opportunity to explore SwiftUI,
since it was relatively new to me at that time. Hence, Swiftcord was born!

## FAQ

Covers a few common questions I have encountered, click on the question
to expand the answer

<details>
  <summary><b>Will I get banned for using Swiftcord/Is using Swiftcord illegal?</b></summary>
    Nobody really knows what Discord's official stance on unofficial clients is. 
    However, hundreds of people and I have been using Swiftcord for quite a while, 
    and nobody has been banned to date.
  <i>
    I do not take any responsibility for account bans due to the use of Swiftcord,
    whether direct or indirect, although there's a very low possibility of that occurring. 
    I recommend trying Swiftcord with an alt if possible.
  </i>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Feature <i>x</i> is missing! When will <i>y</i> be implemented?</b></summary>
  Swiftcord currently is in the alpha stage, and hasn't achieved feature
  parity with the official Discord client yet (it's quite far behind). 
  Many features are planned, but I do not currently have a timeline for them. 
  Development is progressing at a fast pace, but sometimes bugs may take an unexpectedly long time to fix.
  I appreciate contributions, bug reports, and suggestions :)
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Swiftcord just crashed!</b></summary>
  Although I'm aiming for 0 crashes (which is made easier by Swift),
  sometimes the unexpected happens xD. If you experience a crash, please
  open an issue with appropriate information like the line the error
  occurs on, relevant logs, and what you were doing that might have caused
  the crash. If you can solve the bug causing the crash, that's even better!
